  <p> This is a map of Turkmenistan's capitol Ashgabat. I have placed a marker on
    the Alem Center, a polygon around Ashgabat Stadium, and a circle around the Yyldz Hotel, representing three significant places in Ashgabat.
    The Alem Center is known for having the world's
    <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-ferris-wheel-indoors"> largest indoor ferris wheel </a>
    and the Ashgabat Stadium is known for holding the world's <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/378333-largest-cycling-awareness-lesson"
    > largest cycling awareness lesson</a>. The <a href="https://www.yyldyzhotel.com/en"> Yyldz Hotel </a> is one of the best hotels Ashgabat and offers
    one of the best views of Ashgabat along with a 5 star service not found anywhere else.
    The polyline represents a 4.5 mile route between the Alem Center and the Ashbgabat Arena.</p>
